This is an Authentication web application with a task managment for each user.

To use the app, users must first create an account and log in, OR, sign in with Discord. Once authenticated, they can create, view, update, and delete their own task lists from a local SQL database.

Also, you can check more details about this project API at `nest-authask-api/README.md`, and i still have to record two videos (desktop & mobile) showing the front-end consuming the API at `angular-front/README.md`.

If you think you found any error or bug on my code please contact me, this project was intended to be only for learning purposes.

**ANGULAR**: Untill now i've tried only React and Angular for front-end frameworks, but angular is absolutely my favorite.

**NestJS**: This is my first project with NestJS, the structured way of building things inspired by Angular is absolutely impecable.

**BOOTSTRAP**: To be honest i was really attached to Tailwind CSS and this is also my first time using Bootstrap on a project. I thought i wouldn't like it very much, but it's actually really great.

**MySQL**: I spent some time thinking which DB i should've use, a NoSQL like MongoDB or MySQL with SQL, but since i wanted to practice TypeORM i decided to use a SQL-based database.

## Honorable Mention

[Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - This ***litle fella*** helped me alot in the whole process of building this project, i'm amazed about the things AI are capable of these days.
