## Difficulties

I had some problem with the passport-discord strategy, since i didn't find out how could i handle errors when the user doesn't authorize the discord application to access it's information, it just stays at `auth/discord/redirect` with a {"message":"Unauthorized","statusCode":401}. But when authorized, the client gets the discord user info.
